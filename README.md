# Enhancing Emotional Well-Being in Healthcare  
### *Facial Emotion Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*  
#### By: Aditya Girish Anand

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project builds a **real-time facial emotion recognition system** designed to support emotional well-being monitoring in healthcare environments. Using a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**, the model classifies seven emotions from live video input:  
**Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise**.  


The goal is to enable healthcare providers to detect patient emotions, improve communication, and offer more empathetic, personalized care — especially for children, dementia patients, and individuals unable to express emotions verbally.

## 🧪 System Architecture  
The project follows a clear 6-module architecture:  


1. **Input Module** – Captures real-time video frames  
2. **Preprocessing Module** – Face detection (Haar Cascade), region extraction, 48×48 resizing  
3. **CNN Module** – Extracts hierarchical features through convolution & pooling  
4. **Training Process** – Backpropagation with categorical cross-entropy loss  
5. **Output Module** – Predicts emotion via Softmax  
6. **Display Module** – Renders real-time emotion label on screen
